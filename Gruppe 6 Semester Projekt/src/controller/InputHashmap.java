/**
 *The object of this class is to remove the items- and room- descriptions from the game code
 * and storing them in a separate file, to increase readability of the code.
 * we use a FileReader to read a file as a string input, and wrap it in the BufferedReader to get it line by line and then preforms a split at the first occurrence of : in the line
 this code forgoes any error detection based on Wrong syntax in the file, therefore it is important that each change in the file gets cheeked by the ImputFileHashmapTest class before the revisions are shipped
